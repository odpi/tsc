    * Abstract
       > ODPi creates open source standards to help you use and understand data across all platforms. 
      ODPi is a non-profit organization supported by The Linux Foundation and dozens of individuals and member organizations. Members are committed to simplifying and standardizing the data ecosystem so that data can be easily and securely shared across products, platforms, and systems. Learn more about the people and organizations involved in ODPi or to access publicly available resources.
      Join us to learn about the latest approaches from ODPi Projects including Egeria, BI & AI, and OpenDS4All. You will gain insight and roadmaps about several open source projects under the ODPi umbrella that can help you with your data strategies.

     * This month added 1 new contributor and 2 new maintainers.
     * Gartner contacted LF and requested interview with Egeria leads as they are getting requests from their
     customers to provide opinion on Egeria.  Gartner contact was Jason Medd. 
     Mandy and John spoke to him for 1 hour on the project, its background, operation and capability. 
     Followed up by sending presentation on Egeria.
     * Chris Grote is working on a catalog interoperability study lead by the EDM Council (https://edmcouncil.org/?)
     They are looking at providing general principles for interoperability using Egeria as a template.
     * Competitive news: Informatica has just bought Compact solutions and is putting out a 
     [strong message on metadata integration](https://blogs.informatica.com/2020/07/02/leave-no-metadata-behind-with-ai-powered-data-catalog-advanced-scanners/). 
     Egeria is a stronger solution because it does not lock an enterprise into a single, centralized, proprietary metadata store.
