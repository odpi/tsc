    * Second adopter - Oklahoma State University - 150 students
    * Other adopters in pipeline
    * Seeking content for 2 open source AI open source projects around explainable AI
    * License file scan - making small changes to a couple of files to clean up report
    * Looking to create a dojo - may be for next month
   
  * ODPi BI & AI - Cupid
  
    The options below will be voted on in next Friday's call
    
    * Option 1: Bridge API: Build library (npm/Python/Java/Go…etc). On one hand it spawns a child process (in Python or other chosen language) calling AI frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow and PyTorch) to train or run a model, on the other hand, it exposes an API to allow frontend (e.g. Angular or React) to get immediate update of an result.
    
    * Option 2: Human-centered AI: The idea is when the industry talked about AI in the past few years, we focus a lot on Machine Learning. However, just like in traditional schooling system, Learning is only half of the equation - the other half is TEACHING. And we are missing Machine TEACHING which is where the Human-centered portion comes in. Guess who has a long history to enable human interacting with data. That’s BI!!!! It also aligns with what I shared with the team earlier about AI + BI = CI, by combining the Speed of a machine can offered in AI and the Direction intuited by Human, we can achieve the ultimate Cognitive Intelligence. So, our bridge can focus on to building up a framework to enable Human-Centered AI
 
    * Option 3: The bridge for AI/BI will provide a mechanism to handle administration, training and return results and be able to return explanations. It should allow BI users to pass data or pointers to the data if it exists in the cloud and provide a manner in which cognitive information regarding data sensitivity can be maintained and report data drift as it starts occurring.
     
    * Option 4: With the rapid development of data science and data platforms, user communities from all over the world have an opportunity to bridge previously opaque and massive data workloads into one data library for further analysis/consumption.
     
    * Option 5: Further, BI tools can now be used to promote greater transparency and new insight within even more communities than ever before
     
    * Option 6: The Bridge for AI/BI (data shared for use by both) is a platform-agnostic (doesn’t matter whether it’s on premise, in the cloud, or virtual) and tool-agnostic (doesn’t matter whether it is MicroStrategy, Power BI, Qlik, SAS, or Tableau) exchange (API, connector, etc) that allows for AI technologies to inter-operate with BI technologies likely using data as the medium for the exchange. 
     
    * Option 7: It defines how a BI system interfaces with an AI system, and delegates "what" to expose to the BI system, however includes specific components relevant to BI (e.g. triggers for db refresh or providing metadata about the sensitivity/security of input variables). The definition includes training, inference (predict), and model definition endpoints.
     
    * Option 8: this bridge presents an automatic gateway for generating new BI insights based on a black box but regulated AI framework.

  
  * ODPi Egeria - Mandy and Maryna
     * Release 2.2 branched - but still have issues in containers
     * Team working on the definition of a project level TSC:
        * [Link to proposal](https://github.com/odpi/data-governance/wiki/ODPi-Egeria-Weekly-Meeting-10th-September-2020)
     * *All about graphs* webinar went well
        * [Link to replay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgeOAJF6jq8&t=4s)
           
* AOB 
  * Additional integration suggestions: Apache Druid - still to look at
  * Also from Arun ...

  Evaluate Possibility of Using Spacy for Entity Recognition for MetaData - in Egeria .
  
  I wanted to discuss/brainstorm with you(experts) on the possibility of using Named Entity recognition using spacy, in Egeria
  Do you think a Natural Language processing tool that identifies various Entity will help us in building better meta data.
  
  Following in a link on how NLP SPACY is used for better Meta Data recognition.

  Have a good day.
